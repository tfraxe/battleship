# Battleship

## Description

This was one of my first "big" projects on univerisity. I didn't even know how to use git yet (well, I still don't know much...)! However, I was somewhat proud of the result. 

It's a classic battleship game. You play against the computer. 

## How to start playing

0. `git clone` the repository
1. open a terminal, `cd` into the game's directory, and type `make` (_make_ sure you have it installed xD)
2. run _main_.
